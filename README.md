### 🧰 Currently working on:
- Automating silence with [SIGNALFORGE](https://github.com/bubbosvilup/project-SIGNALFORGE)
- Tiny UIs that do one thing well
- Smuggling commits into history for no reason

### 🧪 Not afraid to:
- Push empty commits
- Write code that looks like it does something
- Design interfaces for invisible problems
